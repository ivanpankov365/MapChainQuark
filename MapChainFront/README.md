This web application allows the user to create interactive quests.
To do this, the user requests the name of the quest, a point on the map, a
nd a description of the current step. further one more point and the description of the next step and so on. 
This way, a step-by-step game in the real world is realized.
In order that each person could create a quest, 
and everyone could play in it, it is necessary to ensure the reliability of financial transactions between them. 
For this, the quest is realized on the basis of the etherium network. Each new quest creates a smart contract in this network. 
The user can also connect to a smart contract deployed on the network.
Implemented step-by-step payment (a person can at any time refuse to continue passing the quest and return the balance of the deposit)
To reduce the cost of transactions, it was decided to use special Naviaddreses that allow only 7-8 digits 
to store both the coordinates of the point, and a description of the steps and additional materials, such as photos or audio.
